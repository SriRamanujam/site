# Temple ACM Site

Temple ACM's site is built off of the [MEAN](http://mean.io) stack, which basically uses javascript/json at every layer (browser, server and database). The technologies involved are as follows: [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

## Getting Source
To download the source of the website, you'll need to use git's clone feature. This only works if you are registered as a contributor.
```
git clone git@github.com:/temple-acm/site -b revamp
```
If you are not recognized as a contributor, you need to _fork this repository_ and *not* do a vanilla clone.

## Prerequisites
* UNIX Development Environment (OSX, BSD, Linux) - If you're on Windows, try [this guide](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/11287/how-to-run-ubuntu-in-windows-7-with-vmware-player/)
* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/)

### Tools Prerequisites
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Web package manager:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Streaming build manager:

```
$ npm install -g gulp
```

## Running the Site
The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to clone the project and utilize it like this:

Install dependencies:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install

  Use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to start the server:

    $ gulp
    
  Then open a browser and go to:

    https://localhost:3000
    
  OR, if you are on Windows, and therefore running the server in a VM, replace 'localhost' with IP address of the VM.

## Production Setup
In production we change the way we make a few concessions:
- Mongo DB, our database, is run locally on the same box as the web server instead hosted by [Compose](http://compose.io)
- We use environment variables for sensitive information instead of the development defaults
- We use [HAProxy](http://haproxy.org) for reverse proxying
- We *only* support HTTPS

The variables we use are as follows:
- TUACM_LOGPATH - The path where logs will be put
- TUACM_PORT - The port that the web server is listening for HTTP requests on
- TUACM_SESSION_SECRET - The secret used for salting session tokens
- TUACM_MONGO_URL - The connection string for mongo

To setup the environment variables properly, decrypt env.sh.gpg: ```gpg env.sh.gpg```.
Then, run env.sh to setup environment variables for production:
```
chmod +x env.sh
./env.sh
```

To manage and query our data, we use [Robomongo](http://robomongo.org).

## Questions?
Come and ask for assistance or just hangout in our [Slack](http://tuacm.slack.com) channel. Use ```@group``` to notify everyone in the group of your message.
