# Temple ACM Site  [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/temple-acm.png)](https://gitter.im/temple-acm)

Temple ACM's site is built off of the [MEAN](http://mean.io) stack, which basically uses javascript/json at every layer (browser, server and database). The technologies involved are as follows: [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

## Prerequisites
* UNIX Development Environment (OSX, BSD, Linux) - If you're on Windows, try [this guide](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/11287/how-to-run-ubuntu-in-windows-7-with-vmware-player/)
* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/)

### Tools Prerequisites
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Web package manager:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Streaming build manager:

```
$ npm install -g gulp
```

## Running the Site
  The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to clone the project and utilize it like this:

  Install dependencies:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install

  Use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to start the server:

    $ gulp
    
  Then open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3000
    
  OR, if you are on Windows, and therefore running the server in a VM, replace 'localhost' with IP address of the VM.
